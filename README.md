# Curriculum Vitae
My personal CV LaTeX code created from [Awesome CV LaTeX Template](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) with more features.

## Usage
To generate a PDF from this LaTeX code, navigate to this folder in a terminal and run:

    xelatex resume.tex

## Requirements
You will need to have `xelatex` installed on your machine.

Alternatively, you can use a site like [ShareLaTeX](https://sharelatex.com) or [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to build and edit your LaTeX instead.
