      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {In the context of \textbf{Industry 4.0} for the \textit{Predictive Maintenance} scenario, I deployed as a Docker container an end-to-end Machine Learning platform for Multiple Multivariate Time Series Prediction from extraction of simple statistical features (eg. means, standard deviations, maximum and minimum values, skewness, kurtosis, etc.) and typical domain type related features (eg. Fourier transform, etc.) to model-building to predictions. 
This platform has two main components: a web frontend written in JavaScript that allows interactive exploration of machine learning pipeline and a backend written in Python and composed by Cesium ML algorithms for time-series inference (eg. Random Forest, Linerar Regression, etc.) and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model trained in Keras.}
        \item {In the context of \textbf{Smart City} for the \textit{Smart Bins} scenario, I trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the recognition of waste to be differentiated into paper, plastic, glass or undifferentiated and I deployed as a Docker container in Tensorflow Serving to made it available through RESTful API.}
        \item {In view of the participation at the \textbf{Mobile World Congress 2019} in Barcelona I deployed in TensorFlow Serving a pre-trained object detection model for the real-time recognition and counting of people present on all Exprivia S.p.A. stands.}
